At this time, only about 4,000 acres of land was under cultivation in Deerfield. It was very much still virgin land. Both were intrigued by the potential the land had, and Alice decided that they should stay to make a life there. In February 1910, the couple opened a small store. Additionally, a second daughter was born, however she too soon passed away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

However, he took a keen interest in the potential of agriculture in Deerfield Beach. In 1912, he would acquire 50 acres for farming, where he grew green beans, zucchini, squash, watermelon, etc. James saw an excellent opportunity of exporting his product along the east coast by the Florida East Coast Railway, built by Henry Flagler. Over time, he would substantially grow his farm until he was one of the largest landowners in the region. This enabled the Butler family to acquire a vast amount of wealth.&nbsp;</p>

The Butler House was bequeathed to the Deerfield Beach Historical Society in 1976. Today, it is a part of the National Register of Historic Places and can be toured by the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

David Lenhart, a member of the Deerfield Beach Historical Society, stated “They recognized that they were in the DNA of this community.” They had a vision of a community of good people, hard work, and dedication, and utilized their influence to achieve this vision, and would work to further this vision until James’s death on September 17th, 1965, and Alice’s death on December 17th, 1976, respectively.&nbsp;</p>

She was known to bake treats for the children in the community throughout her life. Their loss of three children was especially heartbreaking because of this. Through her generosity, Alice decided to use the funds of the Butler family to create the J.D. Butler and Alice Butler Scholarship Foundation upon her death to help fund education for graduates of Deerfield Beach High School.

        <p class="u-align-center u-custom-font u-font-playfair-display u-text u-text-2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;​The Butler’s integral role in the development of Deerfield Beach, the Butler House, and finally this scholarship ensure that the impact of J.D. and Alice Butler will be felt for many future generations in Deerfield Beach. This shared experience of history keeps the community together. Perhaps the most important thing to learn from the Butlers, at least according to the Deerfield Beach Historical Society, is that character matters. Hard working, honest people are integral to a healthy community and to make the world better. J.D. and Alice Butler are a testament to this principle and serve as an example that anyone can improve their community.</p>
